Project Title: AI-Powered Task Scheduler

Description:
The AI-Powered Task Scheduler is a project developed as part of my learning journey. It is an intelligent task scheduling application that utilizes artificial intelligence to generate daily schedules based on user-provided tasks and meal times. The application employs natural language processing and OpenAI's GPT language model to understand and generate coherent schedules.

Technologies Used:

Python programming language
OpenAI GPT language model
Git version control system
How It Works:

User inputs their tasks for the day, including activities, study/work sessions, and meal times (breakfast, lunch, dinner).
The application processes the user's inputs and sends them as a prompt to the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model.
The model generates a schedule by considering the tasks, their durations, and the specified meal times.
The generated schedule is returned to the application.
The application formats and displays the schedule to the user, incorporating the specified meal times and task durations.
This project serves as a practical application of artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques, demonstrating how AI can be leveraged to automate and optimize task scheduling processes. It showcases the potential of AI technologies in assisting with daily planning and time management.
